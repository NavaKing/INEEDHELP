# INEEDHELP
IT Help Desk Ticket Tracker
 
# I Need Help! Technical Ticket Tracker
The "I Need Help!" techincal ticket tracker application is designed with the user in mind. Users are able to create a ticket with a simple form, rate the urgency of their issue, update their tickets, and close out completed tickets. Users are also able to sort their tickets in alphabetical order and search for tickets via first/ last name, email, urgency, or keyword.

# Technologies Used:
The following sections will detail the technologies used to build this application. The Back-end of our application was build using Java and Springtool v4. Our Front-end was developed with: React.js, Node.js, and Bootstrap. Finally, the database we have used is SQL.
 
# The Back-end: Java with Springboot v4
Backend development was accomplished using Java and Springboot Tool v4. Because Java is object-oriented, it allows developers to create modular programs and reusable code. This streamlines the coding process and makes updating, expanding, and debugging much simpler and easier. Java is also platform-independent so anyone on any machine can write code with it.
 
# The Front-End: React.js
React.js has multiple advantages for developing applications such as ours. React is focused and easy to learn, it comes with a helpful set of developer tools, and it guarantees stable code just to name a few. We really enjoyed digging into React and discovering how it could help make our application the best it could be.
 
# The Front-End: Bootstrap
Do not let the lightweight nature of the Bootstrap framework fool you. It is fully customize-able, has responsive structures and styles, and fewer Cross browser bugs than other similar frameworks. Bootstrap also has the advantage of being able to use both CSS and Javascript which gives the developer a wider range of options when designing the UI.
 
# The Front-End: Node.js
Node.js helps in the execution of JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is an open-source, JavaScript run-time environment that offers many benefits for web app development. Node.js is scale-able both vertically and horizontally. It also allows developers to add extra resources to a single node during vertical scaling of an application. It is regarded as a full-stack JavaScript because it can serve both the client and server-side applications. This saves valuable time and money, especially for start-ups and new developers like us.
 
# The Database: SQL
We chose to use SQL as our database because it has a standardized language, portability, and multiple data views that make it ideal for an application like ours. Learning how to use SQL is relatively easy, no previous coding knowledge is required, so getting your project up and running requires fewer resources and less time.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
